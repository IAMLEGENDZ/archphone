# ArchPhone
A project what aims to get GNOME Shell, Arch Linux and Wayland working on Android tablets/phones

# Why? There is Ubuntu Touch already!
Actually, Ubuntu Touch gave me an idea for this.

I would like to run normal desktop apps with my phone, but that seems impossible on Ubuntu Touch.

# Initial project goals
- Research how does Android boot.
- Do some research at Google Nexus 5 drivers and kernel.
- Get Arch Linux installed on Google Nexus 5 and get display working
- Run Weston with freedreno driver
- Usable GNOME DE (with keyboard and mouse at first place)
- Install Chromium and things I normally use
- Touchscreen here I come
- Get camera and bluetooth working (libhybris??)
- Make kernel only to boot into Arch Linux (Android features removed)
- Get 3G/4G and SMS working (but no calling)
- On-screen keyboard maybe?
- Release images (fastboot packages)

## Things that could stop this project:
- Binary wifi/BT/camera drivers
- Freedreno driver, which maybe doesn't work with Nexus 5 GPU
